# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Smartphones-Data-Set
please refer to the CodeBook.pdf file which is a slightly edited version of the Rmd output.
If you use R-Studio you can easily re-create / re-run the process of tidying the data with the actual Rmd file which is also included.

The program is also included in the Rmd and the CodeBook created from it, the run-analysis.R is also included in the repository separately to conform the requirements.

The data before calculation (the tidy input dataset) is in the file phonemotions.csv.
The data after calculation is included in the motionmeans.csv and motionmeans.txt files the latter is the same as the file in the Coursera asignment, the former I already made when I found out that the requirements were slightly different and I left that one in place.

I thank the reviewers for their effort and hope you enjoyed the assignment.
