# Human-Activity-Recognition-Using-Smartphones-Data-Set
please refer to the CodeBook.pdf file which is a slightly edited version of the Rmd output.

The program is also included in the Rmd and the CodeBook created from it, the run-analysis.R is also included in the repository separately to conform the requirements.

The data before calculation (the tidy input dataset) is in the file phonemotions.csv.
The data after calculation is included in the motionmeans.csv file (as you may infer also from the program code)

I thank the reviewers for their effort and hope you enjoyed the assignment.
