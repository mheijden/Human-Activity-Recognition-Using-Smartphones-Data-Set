please refer to the added html file which is a slightly edited version of the Rmd output.
To open in readable form pls rightclick on the link of the run_analysis.html and open in a new tab or window.

The code book is included int the run_analysis.html as well as the program (also included in the Rmd), the latter is also included in the repository separately to conform the requirements.

The actual html output from the code was slightly altered to keep the total readable.

I thank the reviewers for their effort and hope you enjoyed the assignment.
